## Overview

A terminal emulator for JappeOS, built with Flutter.

## Features

* Tabs
* A simple terminal

## Role in the OS

A system app that provides a text-based interface to interact with the operating system's command-line shell.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.38.0 or later (with desktop support enabled)
- Dart SDK (included with Flutter)

Verify Flutter desktop setup:

```bash
$ flutter doctor
```

### Setup

Clone the repository and fetch dependencies:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JappeOS/jappeos_terminal.git
$ cd jappeos_terminal
$ flutter pub get
```

### Build

#### Linux

```bash
$ flutter build linux
```

This produces a binary in:
```
build/linux/x64/release/bundle/
```

Run locally:
```bash
$ flutter run -d linux
```

#### Other platforms

While running on Linux is recommended, you can still build and run on other platforms.
Just use the above instructions, and replace `linux` with the platform name (e.g. `windows` or `macos`).

#### Build Modes

* `debug` - default for development
* `profile` - performance testing
* `release` - production build

Example:
```bash
$ flutter build linux --release
```

#### Troubleshooting

If the build fails after dependency changes:
```bash
$ flutter clean
$ flutter pub get
```
Check `flutter doctor` for missing desktop dependencies.
